# Refactorial

Refactoiral is a Clang-based refactoring tool for C, C++, Objective-C, and Objective-C++. It has a number of nice properties:

1.  It runs independent of any IDE
2.  It refactors C, C++, Objective-C and Objective-C++ programs
3.  It can refactor both a library and its clients using the same script, so that library developers can upgrade libraries more easily by distributing the script
4.  It is extensible


## Installation

There are two ways to install Refactorial:

*   Download a pre-built binary. Currently on Mac OS X only. Get it here:
    https://github.com/lukhnos/refactorial/downloads
*   Build on your own. See below.


## Building Refactorial

We have built Refactorial on both Linux and Mac OS X.

You need the following dependencies:

*   LLVM and Clang
*   yaml-cpp
*   Boost (needed by yaml-cpp)
*   pcre
*   hwaf

For LLVM and Clang, you need to build them from the latest source. *Using the
built-in one that comes with Xcode 4.2 won't work*.

Use the latest yaml-cpp from source (most binary distributions won't work).
Get it from http://code.google.com/p/yaml-cpp/source/checkout

For Boost and pcre, you can install them in whatever way you like. Latest
binary distribution versions will do.

To build Refactorial, you need to use the latest Clang compiler. yaml-cpp uses
templates extensively and some instantiations can't be compiled using older
Clang versions. gcc should also work.

Refactorial is written in C++11, although Clang will happily compile it
even without turning on C++11 (we don't use that much other then `auto`).
If you want to build Refactorial with C++11 on (`--std=c++0x`), you'll
probably also need to build LLVM, Clang, yaml-cpp and pcre with the same
option. Which can be a pain due to linkage issues.

To build Refactorial, do this:

```sh
# usual hwaf dance
$ hwaf init some-dir
$ cd some-dir
$ hwaf setup .

# real work
$ hwaf pkg co git://github.com/sbinet/refactorial
$ hwaf configure
$ hwaf
```

## Using Refactorial

### Generating `compile_commands.json`

Clang-based tools (to be specific, those that use LibTooling) use the
"compilation database" to know which source files to parse with which
compiler options. It can be seen as a condensed Makefile.

CMake, which is a popular GNU Autotools replacement ("`./configure; make`"),
will happily generate the compilation database for your CMake project:

    cmake -DCMAKE_EXPORT_COMPILE_COMMANDS:STRING=ON <your build dir>
    
LLVM incidentally also uses CMake, and so do many popular open source projects.

There is currently no way to generate a compilation database out of a
Makefile or an IDE project (e.g. Microsoft `.vcproj` or Xcode's `.xcodeproj`).
That's something that we need to work on.


## Transforms Provided

*   **Accessor**: Synthesize getters and setters for designated member variables
*   **MethodMove**: Move inlined member function bodies to the implementation file
*   **ExtractParameter**: promote a function variable to a parameter to that function
*   **TypeRename**: Rename types, including tag types (enum, struct, union, class), template classes, Objective-C types (class and protocol), typedefs and even bulit-in types (e.g. `unsigned` to `uint32_t`)
*   **RecordFieldRename**: Rename record (struct, union) fields, including C++ member variables
*   **FunctionRename**: Rename functions, including C++ member functions

You tell Refactorial using a YAML config file. For example, to rename all
classes with the prefix `Tree` to `Trie`, you can write a `refactor.yml` like
this:

    ---
    Transforms:        
      TypeRename:
        Ignore:
          - /usr/.*
          - /opt/.*
        Types:
          - class Tree(.*): Trie\1
          
Here `\1` is the regular expression capture directive.

Then, in your build directory (where you have the compilation database), run:

    refactorial < refactor.yml
    
Refactorial will then run the TypeRename transform on all source files in your
project.

If you only need to refactor some of the files, you can say:

    ---
    Files:
      - foo.cpp
      - bar.cpp
    Transforms:        
      TypeRename:
        Ignore:
          - /usr/.*
          - /opt/.*
        Types:
          - class Tree(.*): Trie\1

More documentation upcoming. Before that, take a look at our test cases in
`tests/`. You can get an idea what each source transform does and which
parameters they take.
